# datetimepicker-material
Material design date and time pickers based off the Android native source.

## Where the code comes from

This project forked from hour-minute-picker-project which was in turn a fork of the lollipop-release of https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/datetimepicker.

The hour-minute-picker-project brought in the android source and updated it to the lollipop look (which isn't included in the lollipop-release, strangely enough) manually with the help of this pull request to yet a different fork of the Android datetimepicker - https://github.com/flavienlaurent/datetimepicker/pull/81.

The intent of the hour-minute-picker was to create a custom picker based off the lollipop (or as close to lollipop as possible) date and time pickers.  Since the lollipop date and time pickers would be useful on their own, this fork was created.
